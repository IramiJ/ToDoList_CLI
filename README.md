# ToDoList_CLI
Small programming project to help me get started with programming again. 

This is a command like based todo list, that works on a very simple level. It allows you to delete/add tasks and view them.

I also added a file organizer, that allows you to sort files by Texts, Images, PDFs and others. 

On top of that, the Muiltitool CLI also includes a little calculator that allows you to perform basic actions, such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication

In the end, i combined everyhting into one big multitool that works through the command line.

This Project was mainly made to help me refresh my coding skills and get me back into python/programming
